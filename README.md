# PythonCode
This is my Python codebase, which contains all the code I wrote myself and the information jobs in our school. 

The code inside is free to download, compile and use, but it is licensed to cykzht, and my WeChat public number: cykzhtrldzp

We are honored to be able to study at the alma mater of the national leader. 

At the same time, we also have a very responsible information teacher, and we are always learning how to write code.
